# Displaying Dotkernel API endpoints using dot-cli

## Usage

Run the following command in your applicationâ€™s root directory:

```shell
php ./bin/cli.php route:list
```

The command runs through all routes and extracts endpoint information in realtime.
The output should be similar to the following:

```text

## Filtering results

The following filters can be applied when displaying the routes list:

* Filter routes by name, using: `-i|--name[=NAME]`
* Filter routes by path, using: `-p|--path[=PATH]`
* Filter routes by method, using: `-m|--method[=METHOD]`

The filters are case-insensitive and can be combined.
