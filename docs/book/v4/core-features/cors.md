# CORS

## What is CORS?

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** or _CORS_ is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other
origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.

## Why do we need CORS?

When integrating an API, most developers have encountered the following error message:

> Access to fetch at _RESOURCE_URL_ from origin _ORIGIN_URL_ has been blocked by CORS policy:
> No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource.

This happens because the API (_RESOURCE_URL_) is not configured to accept requests from the client (_RESOURCE_URL_).

## How to fix?

DotKernel API fixes this issue using the [mezzio/mezzio-cors](https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-cors) library.

### Step 1: Install library

In order to install `mezzio/mezzio-cors`, run the following command:

```shell
composer require mezzio/mezzio-cors
```

### Step 2: Configure your API

#### Register ConfigProvider

Register `mezzio/mezzio-cors` in your application by adding its ConfigProvider to your application's config aggregator.
Open the file `config/config.php` and paste the below lines at the beginning of the array passed to `ConfigAggregator`:

```php
Laminas\Diactoros\ConfigProvider::class,
Mezzio\Cors\ConfigProvider::class,
```

Save and close the file.

#### Add middleware

Add `mezzio/mezzio-cors` middleware to your application's pipeline.
Open `config/pipeline.php` and paste the below line before the one with `RouteMiddleware::class`:

```php
$app->pipe(\Mezzio\Cors\Middleware\CorsMiddleware::class);
```

Save and close the file.

#### Create config file

Create and open file `config/autoload/cors.local.php` and add the following code inside it:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Mezzio\Cors\Configuration\ConfigurationInterface;

return [
    ConfigurationInterface::CONFIGURATION_IDENTIFIER => [
        'allowed_origins' => [
            ConfigurationInterface::ANY_ORIGIN,
        ],
        'allowed_headers' => ['Accept', 'Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
        'allowed_max_age' => '600',
        'credentials_allowed' => true,
        'exposed_headers' => [],
    ],
];
```

See below list that explains the above configuration values:

- `allowed_origins`: an array of domains that are allowed to interact with the API
(default `ConfigurationInterface::ANY_ORIGIN` which means that any domain can make requests to the API)
- `allowed_headers`: an array of custom headers allowed
- `allowed_max_age`: the maximum age, the preflight response may be cached by a client
- `credentials_allowed`: if a request is allowed to pass cookies
- `exposed_headers`: an array of headers which are being exposed by the endpoint

Save and close the file.

> On the **production** environment, make sure you allow only specific origins by adding them to the `allowed_origins`
> array and removing the current value of `ConfigurationInterface::ANY_ORIGIN`.
