# Transition approach  [WIP]

Dotkernel API is not a one-to-one replacement of api-tools ( former Apigility), but is only a potential solution to migrate to.

Functionalities, components and architecture are different. 

See the [Comparison between Dotkernel APi and api-tools](https://docs.dotkernel.org/api-documentation/v4/transition-from-api-tools/api-tools-vs-dotkernel-api/)

## Business cases

There are at least 2 approaches for this transition:

### Clone 1:1
and recreate all endpoints and entities

### Build a new version of the current API using Dotkernel API 
and keep it running as separate platforms until the sunset of the current version of api-tools
