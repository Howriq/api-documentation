# Authentication

Authentication is the process by which an identity is presented to the application. It ensures that the entity
making the request has the proper credentials to access the API.

**DotKernel API** identities are delivered to the application from the client through the `Authorization` request.
If it is present, the application tries to find and assign the identity to the application. If it is not presented,
DotKernel API assigns a default `guest` identity, represented by an instance of the class
`Mezzio\Authentication\UserInterface`.

## Configuration

Authentication in DotKernel API is built around the `mezzio/mezzio-authentication-oauth2` component and is already
configured out of the box. But if you want to dig more, the configuration is stored in
`config/autoload/local.php` under the `authentication` key.

## How it works

DotKernels API authentication system can be used for SPAs (single-page applications), mobile applications, and
simple, token-based APIs. It allows each user of your application to generate API tokens for their accounts.

The authentication happens through the middleware in the `Api\App\Middleware\AuthenticationMiddleware`.

## Database

When you install **DotKernel API** for the first time, you need to run the migrations and seeders. All the tables
required for authentication are automatically created and populated.

In DotKernel API, authenticated users come from either the `admin` or the `user` table. We choose to keep the admin
table separated from the users to prevent users of the application from accessing sensitive data, which only the
administrators of the application should access.

The `oauth_clients` table is pre-populated with the default `admin` and `frontend` clients with the same password as
their names (**we recommend you change the default passwords**).

As you guessed each client serves to authenticate `admin` or `user`.

Another table that is pre-populated is the `oauth_scopes` table, with the `api` scope.

### Issuing API Tokens

Token generation in DotKernel API is done using the `password` `grand_type` scenario, which in this case allows
authentication to an API using the user's credentials (generally a username and password).

The client sends a POST request to the `/security/generate-token` with the following parameters:

- `grant_type` = password.
- `client_id` = column `name` from the `oauth_clients` table
- `client_secret` = column `secret` from the `oauth_clients` table
- `scope` = column `scope` from the `oauth_scopes` table
- `username` = column `identity` from table `admin`/`user`
- `password` = column `password` from table `admin`/`user`

```shell
POST /security/generate-token HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "grant_type": "password",
  "client_id": "frontend",
  "client_secret": "frontend",
  "scope": "api",
  "username": "test@dotkernel.com",
  "password": "dotkernel"
}
```

The server responds with a JSON as follows:

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 86400,
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...",
    "refresh_token": "def5020087199939a49d0f2f818..."
}
```

Next time when you make a request to the server to an authenticated endpoint, the client should use
the `Authorization` header request.

```shell
GET /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...
```

### Refreshing tokens

DotKernel API can refresh the access token, based on the expired access token's `refresh_token`.

The clients need to send a `POST` request to the `/security/refresh-token` with the following request

```shell
POST /security/refresh-token HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "grant_type": "refresh_token",
  "client_id": "frontend",
  "client_secret": "frontend",
  "scope": "api",
  "refresh_token" : "def5020087199939a49d0f2f818..."
}
```

The server responds with a JSON as follows:

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...",
  "refresh_token": "def5020087199939a49d0f2f818..."
}
```
