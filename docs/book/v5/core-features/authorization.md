# Authorization

Authorization is the process by which a system takes a validated identity and checks if that identity has access to a
given resource.

**DotKernel API**'s implementation of authorization uses `Mezzio\Authorization\Rbac\LaminasRbac` as a model of
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## How it works

In DotKernel API each authenticatable entity (admin/user) comes with their roles table where you can define
roles for each entity. RBAC comes in to ensure that each entity has the appropriate role and permission to access a
resource.

The authorization happens through the `Api\App\Middleware\AuthorizationMiddleware` middleware.

## Configuration

DotKernel API makes use of `mezzio-authorization-rbac` and includes the full configuration.

The configuration file for the role and permission definitions is `config/autoload/authorization.global.php`.

```php
'mezzio-authorization-rbac' => [
    'roles'       => [
        AdminRole::ROLE_SUPERUSER => [],
        AdminRole::ROLE_ADMIN     => [
            AdminRole::ROLE_SUPERUSER,
        ],
        UserRole::ROLE_GUEST      => [
            UserRole::ROLE_USER,
        ],
    ],
    'permissions' => [
        AdminRole::ROLE_SUPERUSER => [],
        AdminRole::ROLE_ADMIN     => [
            'other.routes'
            'admin.list',
            'home'
        ],
        UserRole::ROLE_USER       => [
            'other.routes',
            'user.my-account.update',
            'user.my-account.view',
        ],
        UserRole::ROLE_GUEST      => [
            'other.routes',
            'security.refresh-token',
            'error.report',
            'home',
        ],
    ],
],
```

## Usage

Based on the configuration file above, we have 2 admins roles (`superuser`, `admin`) and 2 users
roles (`user`, `guest`).

Roles inherit the permissions from their parents:

- `superuser` has no parent
- `admin` has `superuser` as a parent which means `superuser` also has `admin` permissions
- `user` has no parent
- `guest` has `user` as a parent which means `user` also has `guest` permissions

For each role we defined an array of permissions. A permission in DotKernel API is basically a route name.

As you can see, the `superuser` does not have its own permissions, because it gains all the permissions
from `admin`, no need to define explicit permissions.

The `user` role, gains all the permission from `guest` so no need to define that `user` can access `home` route, but
`guest` cannot access user-specific routes.
