# OpenAPI documentation

In order to provide an interactive documentation, Dotkernel API implemented
[zircote/swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php).

Using this library, developers are able to automatically generate documentation files that later can be used to provide
a comprehensive overview of the available endpoints, all the details on the requests that it can receive and the
responses these can return.
