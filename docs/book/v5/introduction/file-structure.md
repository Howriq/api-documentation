# File structure

Dotkernel API follows the [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) standards.

It is a good practice to standardize the file structure of projects.

When using Dotkernel API the following structure is installed by default:

![Dotkernel API File Structure!](https://docs.dotkernel.org/img/api/file-structure-dk-api.png)

## Special purpose folders

* `.github`  - containes workflow files
* `.laminas-ci` - contains laminas-ci workflow files

## `bin` folder

This folder contents are

* `clear-config-cache.php` - removes the config cache file (`data/cache/config-cache.php` - available only when development mode is enabled).
* `cli.php` used to build console applications based on [laminas-cli](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-cli)
* `doctrine` - used by the doctrine fixtures to populate the database tables

## `config` folder

This folder contains all application-related config files:

* `cli-config.php`: command line interface configuration used by migrations, fixtures, crons
* `config.php`: registers ConfigProviders for installing packages
* `container.php`: main service container that provides access to all registered services
* `development.config.php.dist`: activates debug mode; gets symlinked as `development.config.php` when enabling development mode
* `migrations.php`: configuration for database migration, like migration file location and table to save the migration log
* `pipeline.php`: contains a list of middlewares, in the order of their execution
* `twig-cs-fixer.php`: configuration file for Twig code style checker/fixer

### `config/autoload` folder

This folder contains all service-related local and global config files:

* `authorization.global.php`: configures access per route for user roles
* `cli.global.php`: configures cli
* `content-negotiation.global.php`: configures request and response formats
* `cors.local.php.dist`: configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, like call origin, headers, cookies
* `dependencies.global.php`: config file to set global dependencies that should be accessible by all modules
* `development.local.php.dist`: gets symlinked as `development.local.php` when enabling development mode - activates error handlers
* `doctrine.global.php`: configuration used by Objectâ€“relational mapping
* `error-handling.global.php`: configures and activates error logs
* `local.php.dist`: local config file where you can overwrite application name and URL
* `local.test.php.dist`: local configuration for functional tests
* `mail.local.php.dist`: mail configuration; e.g. sendmail vs smtp, message configuration, mail logging
* `mezzio.global.php`: Mezzio core config file
* `mezzio-tooling-factories.global.php`: add or remove factory definitions
* `response-header.global.php`: defines headers per route
* `templates.global.php`: dotkernel/dot-twigrenderer config file

## `data` folder

This folder is a storage for project data files and service caches.
It contains these folders:

* `cache`: cache for e.g. Twig files
* `doctrine`: database migrations and fixtures
* `oauth`: encryption, private and public keys needed for authentication
* `data/lock` - lock files generated by [`dotkernel/dot-cli`](https://docs.dotkernel.org/dot-cli/v3/lock-files/)

> AVOID storing sensitive data on VCS!

## `log` folder

This folder stores daily log files.
When you access the application from the browser, (if not already created) a new log file gets created in the format specified in the `config/autoload/error-handling.global.php` config file under the `stream` array key.

## `public` folder

This folder contains all publicly available assets and serves as the entry point of the application:

* `uploads`: a folder that normally contains files uploaded via the application
* `.htaccess`: server configuration file used by Apache web server; it enables the URL rewrite functionality
* `index.php`: the application's main entry point
* `robots.txt.dist`: a sample robots.txt file that allows/denies bot access to certain areas of your application; activate it by duplicating the file as `robots.txt` and comment out the lines that don't match your environment

## `src` folder

This folder contains a separate folder for each Module.

These are the modules included by default:

* `Admin` - contains functionality for managing users with `admin` role; note these are users save in the `admin` database table
* `App` - contains core functionality, from authentication, to rendering, to error reporting
* `User` - contains functionality for managing regular users

### Module contents

Each Module folder, in turn, should contain the following folders, unless they are empty:

* `src/Handler` - Action classes (similar to Controllers but can only perform one action)
* `src/Entity` - Used by database entities
* `src/Service` - Service classes
* `src/Collection` - Database entities collections
* `src/Repository` - Entity repository folder

The above example is just some of the folders a project may include, but they should give you an idea about the recommended structure.
Other classes the `src` folder may include are `InputFilter`, `EventListener`, `Helper`, `Command`, `Factory` etc.

The `src` folder in each Module folder normally also contains these files:

* `ConfigProvider.php` - Configuration data for the module
* `OpenAPI.php` - Detailed descriptions for each endpoint in the OpenAPI format
* `RoutesDelegator.php` - Module specific route registrations

### `templates` folder in Modules

This folder contains the template files, used for example to help render e-mail templates.

> Dotkernel API uses twig as Templating Engine. All template files have the extension `.html.twig`
